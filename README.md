# wandb-launch-demo
A demo repo for Weights &amp; Biases Launch examples

## Running

1. Train
- Train small model on small dataset to verify pipeline and convergence
- Train small model on full dataset
- Train large model on small dataset
- Train large model on full dataset

2. Eval
- Eval script to load a pretrained-model and run evaluation
